# Workbench Access

## Contributing

This repository will eventually be moved to Drupal.org

### Issue tracking

Issues on this github repo are intentionally turned off.
While this repository is private issues will be tracked in Palantir's Redmine: https://redmine.palantir.net/projects/p8-workbench
Once the repository is moved to Drupal.org then that issue queue will be used.

### Development Environment

Palantir developers should use this Vagrant environment for developing Workbench modules: https://github.com/palantirnet/workbench-vagrant

### Testing

Pull requests should include tests. Use Behat or PHPUnit. Do not use Simpletest.
@todo, add more detail to this section: https://redmine.palantir.net/issues/43688
